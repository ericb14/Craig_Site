              <p class=""><br /><br /> I was born in Florida, however I spent my childhood and graduated high school in northern Georgia. After graduating high school I returned to Florida and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Stetson University.
                During my undergraduate work, I also travelled and studied in the Amazon Rainforest, the Florida Keys, skydived, and received my Open Water SCUBA certification, all within a year! Since, then I have realized that it is better to be more
                grounded, often desiring a float-like state, which is why I love the ocean and observing the beauty of life that lies beneath. From experience, I learned to study and appreciate, but more importantly to protect our precious marine ecosystems.
                Long are the days since my childhood, but the memories and camaraderie created will last a lifetime. â€‹<br /><br /> So now when St. Louisans ask me where I went to high school, I tell them St. Louis Community College-Meramec, which is where
                I attained my degree in Horticulture. It was ten years after graduating from a university that I felt the need to be back in school, but this time it was to improve my career. I finally feel at home in St. Louis, living here now for almost
                twenty years, and having my own family. I'm a professional horticulturist having vast experience with fifteen years in the green industry. For the past four years, I have been a stay at home dad, which is truly the most challenging, yet
                rewarding, job that I have ever had. Now my mission is educating and sharing with people that there are natural ways of healing and maintaining our personal well-being. It's time to stop thinking that the first step toward a lifetime of
                health and vitality is often toward the kitchen. It doesn't have to be confined to what's in the refrigerator or even the grocery store. Believe you must begin by providing the need for change and identify the opportunity it provides,
                then you must develop a process to use. Your Journey Begins Here
